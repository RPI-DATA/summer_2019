## Sample Autograding 

The goal of this is to provide an autograding example which integrates OKPY and submitty. 

A foundational component is a standard docker container which can be used for both running the assignment and checking the assignment. 

This example comes from the [binder-examples](https://github.com/binder-examples/jupyter-stacks) repository.

The `gopher` directory has 3 notebooks which can be tested.  There are three questions in each notebook.  

The score should be:
- 0/3 for the file `lab_0_3.ipynb'
- 1/3 for the file `lab_1_3.ipynb'
- 2/3 for the file `lab_2_3.ipynb'
- 3/3 for the file `lab_3_3.ipynb'
